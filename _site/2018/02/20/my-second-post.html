<p>Overview
A trend exists within the computing department at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). For the purposes of this study, the Cal Poly “computing department” consists of the following four majors: Electrical Engineering (EE), Computer Engineering (CPE), Computer Science (CS), and Software Engineering (SE). A growing number of students within these four majors switch between them before they graduate. Many students end up choosing one of these majors in high school without fully understanding the differences between them. Through a combination of primary sources like statistical data from the computing department as well as interviews, and secondary sources like online research, this study aims to analyze the four computing majors in order to gain a better understanding of each. Additionally, this study aims to highlight the common motivations students have to change majors and uncover underlying issues within the programs.</p>

<p>Background
As a computing student who has faced these same concerns, I chose to study the computing majors at Cal Poly to further my understanding of what makes them different from each other. In doing so, I will highlight deeper issues within the majors and their associated curriculum which has caused what seems to be a trend of switching “down the pipeline.” I am defining the Computing Pipeline as the progression of more hardware-based majors to more software-based ones. A visualization of this progression is shown in Figure 1 below. In the context of the Cal Poly computing department, that means EE to CPE to CS and/or SE. I am choosing to include Computer Science and Software Engineering on the same level of the pipeline because they are both software focused, with minimal differences that are discussed later on. Finally, I look at these majors within a larger context to see if other factors have contributed to this pattern, such as industry and future professional opportunities. This study is targeted for a primary audience of students, whether current or prospective. Additionally, the secondary audience consists of Cal Poly and professors who are interested in student feedback regarding the programs.
Figure 1: The Computing Pipeline</p>

<p>Context
Like many others, I applied to Cal Poly as a high school senior into Computer Engineering because it had the word “computer” and “engineering,” two things I am interested in. With no background in either and a desire to learn about both, I decided the mix of hardware and software would be the best place to start. I spent my first year at Cal Poly learning about the major and what I could do with it. From the start, the software side of my major captivated me and I found myself growing more and more passionate about programming and computer science as a whole. Although Computer Engineering is a blend of electrical engineering and computer science, the first year is largely spent on software.  By the end of my first year, I knew I loved software and appreciated hardware for what it could do. However, as I began my search for a summer internship during my second year of Computer Engineering, I came to a realization that my passions truly stayed in Computer Science. Having taken a few Electrical Engineering courses, I found myself much less engaged with the content and saw no direct application of the material I was learning. With that mindset, I knew I would never seek out an EE job or internship. On top of that, CPE-specific jobs and internships were much less common as well, so as a result I ended up looking for software engineering roles. At a certain point, I decided staying in Computer Engineering no longer made sense for the career that I sought. After careful consideration and thought, along with extensive research and insights from peers and mentors, I made the decision to switch my major Computer Science.</p>

<p>Unlike some other students who found zero interest in hardware, I still see its value, but the curriculum for the Computer Engineering program just did not fulfill what I was looking for. In the end, I am grateful to have stayed with the program for a year and a half. I gained a good understanding of computing and had the opportunity to learn about both sides. Some of my favorite courses I have taken would not have been available to me if I entered as a Computer Science student. My story is not unique, and through this whole journey I began to question why this trend existed — Why do so many students seemingly switch, and why is it usually “down the pipeline?”</p>

<p>The Four Computing Majors
We need to learn more about the four computing majors offered at Cal Poly before we continue. I asked Dr. John Oliver, the current director of the Computer Engineering program at Cal Poly, to describe each program and its goals. In addition, he recommended a page written by Professor David Janzen, a professor at Cal Poly who is largely in charge of the Software Engineering Department. This page outlines some differentiating characteristics between the software-based majors.  A summary of what they said and wrote of each major is to follow.</p>

<p>Electrical Engineering seems to be the outlier of the four majors, something mentioned by Dr. Oliver. EE overlaps with CPE in training students to be digital or embedded systems designers, although they are not trained as well in the software. They usually have a better understanding of the electronics in those systems. On a broader scale, electrical engineering students learn about radio frequency transmission, signal processing, and power generation, topics not directly related to computing.</p>

<p>The Computer Science Department aims to develop students who can design efficient software as well its structures and theory of software development. Although the curriculum is programming centric, it does not merely create coders, but those interested in the science of developing software.</p>

<p>Software Engineering is about building software that meets specifications with less interest in the theory behind it. As Janzen says, many of the courses will be the same as Computer Science, with the differences being pretty minimal between them, the main one being a different approach to software development. As a result, Software Engineering students spend more time learning about the process and less about the theory. Because SE is so similar to CS, I have included them in the same level of the Computing Pipeline model.</p>

<p>As a hybrid between Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science, the Computer Engineering Department aims to train students to be software developers with a focus on software that works in conjunction with hardware. This results in a large overlap of the CPE curriculum with EE and CS. Computer Engineering allows students to get a taste of both disciplines and either choose to focus on one or find a place in the middle ground.</p>

<p>One big difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering can be traced back to its history. The former grew out of many Math departments, while the latter grew out of Electrical Engineering. As a result, CS is generally more theoretical, while CPE places more emphasis on practical applications.</p>

<p>Statistics
I said earlier that a good number of students switch between the computing majors. To continue our study, I decided to look at some hard statistics to understand this trend a little more quantitatively. Dr. Oliver, sent me change of major statistics within the College of Engineering for the past five years. For the purposes of this study, here is some relevant data about change of major statistics specifically between computing majors at Cal Poly for the past five years.

<p>Table 3: All Switches Between Computing Majors (Sum of down + against pipeline)
Like previously defined, “down the pipeline” means any switch from the left to right of the spectrum, and vice versa for “against the pipeline.” On the last column of Table 1 and Table 2, the “% of Switches” number was calculated based on the “5 Year Total” of the switches over the “5 Year Total” of all switches listed in Table 3. This data highlights a few interesting things. Although there is not enough years worth of data to make accurate conclusions, there seems to be a trend where down the pipeline switches have increased, either due to increased enrollment or external motivations. Another interesting observation is the contrast of students switching down vs against the pipeline. It is obvious that a much higher percentage of students switch down the pipeline, as illustrated below.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Visualization of Computing Change of Major Percentages by Major and Category
(AP- Against Pipeline, DP - Down Pipeline)</p>

<p>Figure 2 breaks down the percentage of computing major changes by the actual major and whether it was for or against the pipeline. It here that we clearly see the obvious trend of EE and CPE students switching into more software based majors. In contrast, only a few students switch up the pipeline, seen in this graph. Because we are choosing to include CS and SE on the same level, the 9.5% switch against the pipeline of SE can be explained as students mostly moving into CS, an insignificant switch.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Visualization of Computing Change of Major Percentages, Down vs Against Pipeline</p>

<p>Figure 3 simplifies Figure 2 by only showing down vs against pipeline major switches within the computing majors. From this data, it is clear that a large majority (82.1%) of students who switch between the computing majors do so down the pipeline.</p>

<p>Interviews
Data is important to quantify trends, but now let us look into more qualitative data. I had the opportunity to interview seven students in the computing majors here at Cal Poly. They represent a wide range of “cases,” with some switching and some not. These students explained to me why they chose their majors, and if they switched, their primary motivations behind the decision.</p>

<p>To get a good sample of information, I interviewed students with a broad range of computing major experiences. Although this does not completely represent every student in a computing major, my sample is adequate for this study. I would encourage you to watch the full interviews to get a more complete picture of these students and their stories. For the purposes of this analysis, I will only summarize my findings within a smaller scope. Let’s begin with a brief overview of my interviewees.</p>

<p>Nathan is currently a second year Electrical Engineering student who plans on staying in his major. With his dad in the semiconductor industry and mom in computer science, he became exposed to both sides of computing at an early age. He explains how he developed an interest in hardware as opposed to software because computer science, as he says, “wasn’t enough of a hands on experience.” While he’s still figuring out what he wants in a career, it was clear that Nathan resonated much more with the EE curriculum and has no intention of switching majors.</p>

<p>Ty, a second year Computer Engineering student, chose the major because of her experiences both taking computer science classes in high school as well as being a part of her school’s robotics team. Wanting a major that combined multiple components into a “hands on” approach, CPE seemed like a great blend of two disciplines she found interest in. Even though Ty says she would never choose a role that was, “full EE,” she chooses to stay in CPE because of the possibilities and flexibility.</p>

<p>Selynna is a Computer Science student in her second year. She is the only one who could not do an in-person interview with me, so her input is referenced from a document she wrote. Selynna has been extremely involved with hackathons since her sophomore year of high school, a big reason why she chose Computer Science as a major. Since her love of code is such a big part of who she is, there was no question to what she would study in college and is currently working to pursue management roles later on in her career.</p>

<p>Elizabeth is a second year Electrical Engineering student. As part of an engineering exploration course in high school, she found her interest in Electrical Engineering among the other disciplines she was exposed to. After taking a few courses at Cal Poly, she chooses to stay in EE because the software courses she has taken, which she says are less structured than EE curriculum, have not resonated with her.</p>

<p>Justin is a second year Computer Science student who switched from Computer Engineering during his first year. After taking a basic electronics course, he says, “I realized I didn’t have much of an interest for hardware.” Because he did not have a clear picture of what he wanted to do as he came into Cal Poly, Computer Engineering was a good choice for Justin as it gave him the flexibility to figure out his passions, which ended up being the software side of computing.</p>

<p>Dominic is a second year Computer Engineering student who just switched from Electrical Engineering during winter quarter. After working on both hardware and software projects, he realized he, “gravitates more towards the software side of things.” Dominic entered Cal Poly wanting to work on electronic design, but eventually realized that it wasn’t quite what he had in mind. As a result, he chose to switch in order to have a middle ground to explore software designed for hardware.</p>

<p>Michael, a Computer Science alumni, graduated in 2017. He came into Cal Poly initially as a Computer Engineering major, but realized he didn’t like hardware after taking an introductory circuits course. Once he took his first programming course and realized his passion for software, he switched winter quarter of his first year. Now after graduating, his experiences in industry through internships have been exactly what he was looking for, and he has no regrets for the decision he made early on.</p>

<p>That is a quick snapshot of who I talked to. Like I mentioned previously, watch the full video interviews to get a better understanding of each these individuals and their experiences.</p>

<p>Analysis
Now that we have a general understanding of the computing majors and the experiences of students in them, let’s move on and look at some of the motivations for the growing trend we’re calling the Computing Pipeline. If I were to summarize all that I heard from students, faculty, and online research, I would say Michael said it best: “I think people are switching because software is sexy now.” An overwhelming majority of students make the jump because they are pulled, not pushed out of their original major. Because of the demand for software developers, it looks like industry is enticing students to move into more software development roles. Simply put, there seems to be many incentives for being in the software engineering industry right now, with an abundance of jobs (Figure 4) and internships as well as stability and a great salary.</p>

<p>Figure 4: Comparing Software vs Hardware Engineers</p>

<p>Another big factor is the reality that high school seniors don’t really know what they want to study in college, let alone what career they might be interested in. Specifically in regards to Computer Engineering, some end up applying to Cal Poly under CPE either to have the flexibility to expose themselves to both hardware and software, or merely because, “I had no idea what I wanted to do,” and chose the major because it either sounded promising or they heard it could be a good option. Students in both of these camps contributed to the trend by finding an interest in software over hardware and realizing they would no longer pursue a career in one discipline, thus prompting the change. For Electrical Engineering students, a similar story exists where they find interest in the software portion of their hardware projects and make the switch in order to explore that discipline further.</p>

<p>So is software just more inherently interesting than hardware? Something I noticed while interviewing students was how many who switched could specifically name a course that caused them to change majors. Another potential reason, specific to Cal Poly, may be found in the way curriculum is taught in the software versus hardware departments. Currently, introductory software courses are much more hands on and applicable than their hardware counterparts. Students immediate learn concepts and begin implementing them in projects with quick results. Conversely, introductory hardware courses are much more theory focused and math intensive, and are often viewed as much less engaging, boring, or stale. And because Computer Engineering students first take the intro software courses before hardware, many quickly find their passions and switch right as they take their first couple hardware courses. Dr. Oliver hypothesized that if the department changed the order that first year Computer Engineering courses were structured, the number of students who changed majors would decrease dramatically, although that might not be the best decision for both students and the department. It seems at the end of the day that interest in hardware vs software courses will just be personal preference.</p>

<p>The College of Engineering also makes it very easy for students to switch between these majors. “The turnaround time was a day or two to switch from EE to CPE,” says Dominic. And his statement essentially describes the length of the process for all students who meet the GPA minimum, fill out the required Google form, and potentially have an exit interview with their department. If a student wants to switch between computing majors, specifically hardware to software, the college supports that decision.</p>

<p>From a department standpoint, Dr. Oliver also had a couple theories. Good Electrical Engineering requires more theory and mathematics than Computer Science. “Because of that, Electrical Engineering will forever struggle to be engaging to students when compared to Computer Science.” Even with that said, Dr. Oliver shared that the EE department could be doing more to capture the interest of students early on. With an understanding that the EE curriculum at Cal Poly has been largely unchanged for decades, it can be said that many of our hardware courses no longer serve their intended purpose and are less relevant then they used to be.</p>

<p>Conclusion
Is the Computing Pipeline Trend even an issue? “I actually don’t see it as a problem,” says Dr. Oliver. He believes Computer Engineering is a great place to start, as students will be able to see both hardware and software as a discipline. And if they do decide they want to focus solely on software, as is the trend, he is more than happy to support them. He understands that 17 year old students have no capacity to choose a life path, and is glad that many end up finding the right major for them.</p>

<p>Knowing that some curriculum is now outdated, it would seem logical to update courses that are more aligned to the needs of students and industry. The computing departments in many ways are aware of this, and some steps are being taken to address the issue. One course currently being created will replace both EE 112 and IME 156, two basic hardware courses that both EE and CPE students take in their first year. By combining these courses into one, the department hopes to create a more engaging and worthwhile introduction into the world of circuits and electronics. With that said, there are still more courses that could be updated, and some added to teach more relevant topics to the computing industry today. But that is another research study. Although some faculty agree that curriculum should be updated, others still hold a more antiquated view of their discipline, and thus do not see a need for change. It will take a combination of effort from the computing departments as well as trained faculty and support from external sources to see a broader update in the course curriculum.</p>

<p>Now that we have more dynamically defined the four computing majors, I hope for those of you who are either prospective students looking to apply for a computing major at Cal Poly, or a current computing student questioning their major, that the information uncovered here would be helpful in your academic journey. At the end of the day, there is no “right” decision in terms of major or career choice. It is clear that for the past several years, computer science as a discipline has taken off in demand and popularity. And while programming is appealing to more and more students, that doesn’t make it the choice for everyone. It has been clear through my conversations that every student for the most parts ends up graduating in the major that is right for them. Even though some students change their major, many do not. From those that I interviewed, it was clear to me that students who were not switching truly belonged in that major.</p>
